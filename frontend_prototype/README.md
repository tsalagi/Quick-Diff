# QuickDiff Frontend Prototype

This directory contains a prototype version of the QuickDiff text difference checker. It demonstrates the basic interface and features before the full single-file implementation.

## Contents

- `index.html` â€“ Prototype interface where you can compare two blocks of text and see line-by-line differences with basic color coding.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Enter or paste text into the **Original** and **Modified** panes.
3. Click **Run Diff** to view line differences.
4. (Prototype only) No clipboard or sample-load features available here.

_For the full-featured implementation, see the root-level QuickDiff application in the parent directory._
